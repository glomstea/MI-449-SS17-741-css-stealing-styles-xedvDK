    <!--The page includes the name of your search engine in big letters (you can make it up), with a search input below it, then a button below that to run the search (the button doesn't have to do anything for this prototype)
        The font size of the search engine name is at least 70 pixels, so that it's very easy to see
        span elements are wrapped around each letter of the name, like this: <span>G</span><span>o</span><span>o</span><span>g</span><span>l</span><span>e</span>, so that they can be styled individually with classes
        The on-hover colors from the paragraphs on this page are used to color individual letters of your name (similar to the letters in Google's logo)
        Inspect the input element at the bottom of the Prototyping states page of the lesson to create an identical-looking search box for your own site (it should even use the same styles on focus)
        The styles from the “Create Account” button on this page are used for your “Search” button (it should even use the same styles on hover and active)
        There are no stylelint errors in your CSS (this will also be expected for all future projects)
        All your CSS exists in a .css file. -->
